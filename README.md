# Yara-rules
Yara rules for various malware.

*Disclaimer: These are not all inclusive that will catch everything, it will only catch those samples that they are built for. Example The Emotet rule released in Jan 2020 was based on 787 samples out of which 771 had a richheader, naturally those 16 samples that didn't have a richheader will not be caught by that rule which is based on richheader signatures.*
