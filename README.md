# Yara-rules
Yara rules for various malware.

*Disclaimer: These are not all inclusive that will catch everything, it will only catch those samples that they are built for. Example The Emotet rule released in Jan 2020 (Emotet_2019-12-31.yara) was based on 5341 samples out of which 771 had a richheader, naturally those samples that didn't have a richheader will not be caught by that rule which is based on richheader signatures.*
